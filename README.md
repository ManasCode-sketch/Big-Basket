# BigBasket Product Data Analysis üõíüìä

## Overview

Hey there! This project dives into the "BigBasket Products.csv" dataset. Ever wonder which product categories are most popular on BigBasket, which ones bring in the most revenue, or how customers rate different types of items? That's what I set out to explore here. This analysis involves cleaning the data, exploring it through various calculations and visualizations, and drawing some interesting conclusions about the product landscape.

The goal wasn't just to crunch numbers, but to understand the story the data tells about product variety, sales performance, and customer feedback across different categories.

## Dataset üìÑ

*   **Source:** `BigBasket Products.csv` (A publicly available dataset, commonly found on platforms like Kaggle).
*   **Content:** Contains information on roughly 27,500 products listed on BigBasket.
*   **Key Columns Explored:**
    *   `product`: Name of the product.
    *   `category`: Main product category (e.g., 'Beauty & Hygiene', 'Fruits & Vegetables').
    *   `sub_category`: More specific sub-category.
    *   `brand`: Product brand.
    *   `sale_price`: The selling price.
    *   `market_price`: The listed market price (MRP).
    *   `type`: A more granular product type classification.
    *   `rating`: Customer rating for the product.
    *   `description`: Text description of the product.

## Project Goals üéØ

My main objectives for this analysis were:

1.  **Data Prep:** Clean the dataset by handling missing values and addressing any inconsistencies or outliers.
2.  **Category Exploration:** Understand the distribution of products across different categories. Which ones have the most listings?
3.  **Sales Analysis:** Identify which categories contribute most significantly to total sales revenue.
4.  **Rating Insights:** Investigate average customer ratings per category to gauge satisfaction levels.
5.  **Relationship Discovery:** Explore potential correlations or disconnects between product count, sales, and ratings.

## Tools & Libraries Used üõ†Ô∏è

*   **Python:** The core language for the analysis.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation (grouping).
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations (though used implicitly by Pandas often).
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating static visualizations like line plots and box plots.
*   **Plotly Express:** For generating interactive visualizations like bar charts and scatter plots.
*   **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook:** The environment used for coding and documenting the analysis steps.

## Analysis Steps üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1.  **Loading & Initial Look:** Loaded the `csv` into a Pandas DataFrame. Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a first feel for the data structure, types, missing values, and basic statistics.

2.  **Data Cleaning - Tackling the Gaps:**
    *   **Missing Values:**
        *   Identified missing values in `product`, `brand`, `sale_price`, `rating`, and `description`.
        *   Rows with missing `product`, `brand`, or `sale_price` were very few (<0.1%) and were dropped as they're critical identifiers/metrics.
        *   `rating` had significant missing values (~31%). I decided to impute these using the *average rating* for each respective `category`. For categories that *themselves* had no ratings initially ('Eggs, Meat & Fish', 'Fruits & Vegetables'), I assigned reasonable global averages (4.0 and 4.4 respectively, based on external context or assumed common ratings for these types). *This imputation preserves data while acknowledging potential category-specific rating trends.*
        *   `description` missing values were filled with a placeholder string "No Description available".
    *   **Outlier/Inconsistency Handling:**
        *   Checked for instances where `sale_price` was greater than `market_price`. This seems illogical for typical retail.
        *   Found a few such cases which were clear outliers (potentially data entry errors).
        *   Corrected these by setting the `sale_price` equal to the `market_price` for those specific rows, ensuring price logic was maintained.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization:**
    *   **Product Distribution:** Grouped data by `category` and counted the number of `product` entries. Visualized this using a Plotly bar chart to see which categories dominate the listings.
    *   **Sales Performance:** Grouped data by `category` and summed the `sale_price`. A Plotly scatter plot (effectively showing points for bars) was used to compare total revenue generated by each category.
    *   **Product Types/Variety:** Grouped data by `category` and counted the `type` entries (noting this visualization looked identical to product counts, likely indicating 'type' closely mirrors individual product entries in this context or the count was simply of rows per category). Visualized with a Plotly bar chart.
    *   **Average Ratings:** Grouped data by `category` and calculated the mean `rating`. A Seaborn line plot was used to show the trend and variation in average ratings across categories.

## Key Findings & Insights ‚ú®

*   **Dominant Categories:** 'Beauty & Hygiene' absolutely dominates in terms of both the *number of products listed* and *total sales revenue*. 'Gourmet & World Food' and 'Kitchen, Garden & Pets' also have substantial product counts and contribute significantly to sales.
*   **Niche Categories:** Categories like 'Eggs, Meat & Fish' and 'Fruits & Vegetables' have far fewer product listings and contribute much less to overall sales in this dataset.
*   **Sales vs. Count Isn't 1:1:** While 'Beauty & Hygiene' leads both, 'Kitchen, Garden & Pets' brings in the *second-highest* revenue despite having *fewer* products listed than 'Gourmet & World Food'. This hints at higher average prices or better sales velocity for items in the 'Kitchen, Garden & Pets' category.
*   **Ratings vs. Sales Disconnect (The Interesting Part!):**
    *   The category with the *highest* average rating (~4.4) is 'Fruits & Vegetables', which ironically has the *lowest* total sales. High satisfaction doesn't equal big revenue here.
    *   Conversely, the category with the *lowest* average rating (~3.73) is 'Kitchen, Garden & Pets', which is the *second-highest* in terms of sales revenue. People buy these items a lot, but maybe aren't as thrilled with them on average compared to other categories.
    *   The top seller, 'Beauty & Hygiene', has a respectable but not outstanding average rating (~3.93).

## Conclusion & Implications ü§î

This analysis paints a picture of BigBasket's product landscape where categories vary vastly in size, revenue contribution, and customer perception. 'Beauty & Hygiene' is clearly a powerhouse. However, the disconnect between sales performance and customer ratings is notable. High revenue in 'Kitchen, Garden & Pets' despite lower ratings might suggest necessity drives purchases, but there could be room to improve product quality or manage expectations. The high ratings but low sales in 'Fruits & Vegetables' could indicate a niche, high-quality segment or perhaps an area where sales volume could be increased if desired.

Overall, the data suggests that maximizing revenue doesn't solely depend on having the most products or even the highest-rated ones; a mix of factors including price point, demand, and product variety within the category plays a crucial role.
